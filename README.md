This Ultrasonic reference design gives a digital signal that corresponds to a distance value. The values coming from this sensor can be used to determine real world distance, collision detection, or objects detected by simulated radar.

A unique feature of this design is that it saves the need for a fourth wire that most Ultrasonic sensors require, or an external voltage regulator. It's a simple 3-wire design with an integrated 5V regulator on-board.
